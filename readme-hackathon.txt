ddl/oracle files are dumped from the Sanofi RC instance.

Files not replaced by the dump have been removed. These can be
recovered from git if required.

Three users were added to the list: amapp, fmapp and galaxy. All own
tables in this instance, amapp and fmapp are documented as new in
Sanofi.

Two tablespaces were added: galaxy, users (users is used by amapp and fmapp)

Permissions need to be caught for amapp, fmapp and galaxy.


Deleted all sql files that were not generated by the oracle dump

Need to generate_grants and a few other housekeeping tasks (from other files?)
